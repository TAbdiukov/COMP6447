You wander through the valley in search of the mythical treasure.
A landslide has blocked the way at 0xff8befdf
Beside it you notice a hidden doorway cut into the rock wall.
As you approach '9447' appears in magical letters on it.
Speak the phrase APplES and I shall open: 1231321231321

You say, 1231321231321


The magical letters begin to shimmer and morph.
After a while they reform again as '9447'!
This doesn't satisy the door, so it ignores you.
